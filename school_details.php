		<p>
		Way back in 1975, the school came into existence alongside the local Gurudwara. It was the brainchild of Joginder Singh Bhatia. Jagjeet Kaur Bhatia was the Founder Principal. It started with a meager strength of 30 students and 7 teachers. It was under the aegis of Guru Nanak Vidhyak Society for quite some time. In the year 2007, the management of the school was taken over by Sri Guru Gobind Singh Vidhyak Sanstha.
		</p><p>
		The school draws its inspiration from the last Sikh Guru, Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji. The thoughts of Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji are very contemporary and relevant even today.
		</p><p>
		He was a spiritual master, warrior, poet and philosopher. He was the last of the 10 Sikh Gurus and succeeded his father Guru Tegh Bahadur as the leader of the Sikhs at the young age of nine. Among his notable contributions to Sikhism are the Five Ks, the five articles of faith that Khalsa Sikhs wear at all times, initiating the Sikh Khalsa in 1699, and his contribution to the continual formalisation of the religion which Guru Nanak had founded in the 15th century. He was the last of the living Sikh Gurus, passing the Guruship of the Sikhs to the Eleventh and Eternal Sikh Guru, the Guru Granth Sahib Ji.</p>
